# Agent Log — 2025-12-25T23-15Z (Codex / GPT-5.2) — Onboarding

## Goal
Onboard on the `kaggle_clicks` repo and be ready for the next task.

## What I read
- Operating rules: `agents.md`, `docs/AGENT_ONBOARDING.md`
- High-level docs: `README.md`, `docs/DATA.md`, `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/TIME_AGG_EXPERIMENTS.md`
- Paper plan + current results pointers: `docs/plan_for_working_paper_results.md`, `docs/FAMILY_A_RESULTS.md`
- Paper artifact manifest: `paper_draft/v1/README.md`, `paper_draft/v1/WRITER_ONBOARDING.md`
- Recent handoff context: `logs/agents/agent_logs/2025-12-20T20-49_codex.md`, `logs/agents/agent_logs/2025-12-25T19-08_codex.md`, `logs/agents/agent_logs/2025-12-25T23-07_codex.md`

## Current mental model (1 paragraph)
We train CTR models on Avazu with strict out-of-time splits and online-safe features: time-aware target encoding plus streaming entity-history “time aggregation” features (Family A) where features for hour `H` only use events from `<H`. The working paper scope is A.1 window shapes and A.2 window-length sets, evaluated via rolling-tail Fold A/B; results and paper-ready tables are consolidated under `paper_draft/v1/`.

## Notes / next step candidates
- If the next task is paper writing, use `paper_draft/v1/WRITER_ONBOARDING.md` and avoid `runs/` unless debugging.
- If the next task is experimentation, keep runs <5 minutes unless explicitly approved; prefer `--sample-pct 1` smoke runs and reuse TE caches for sweeps.

## What I ran
- No model runs; only file reads for onboarding.
