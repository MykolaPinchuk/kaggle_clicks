# Agent Log — 2025-12-25T23-46Z (Codex / GPT-5.2) — Writer Bundle Packaging

## Goal
Package the v1 writeup, tables, and figures into a single directory that can be dumped to a Writer agent, while keeping Markdown docs to **exactly 2 files** (per constraint).

## Bundle location
- `paper_draft/v1/research_agent_bundle/`

## Markdown constraint check
Only these 2 Markdown files are present:
- `paper_draft/v1/research_agent_bundle/WRITER_BRIEF.md`
- `paper_draft/v1/research_agent_bundle/BUNDLE_README.md`

## Included artifacts
- Tables (CSV): under `paper_draft/v1/research_agent_bundle/tables/`
- Figures (PNG): under `paper_draft/v1/research_agent_bundle/figures/` (curated + grid plot sets + EDA context)
- Repro metadata: under `paper_draft/v1/research_agent_bundle/repro/` (commands/configs)

## What I ran
- File operations only (mkdir/cp) plus a check that `.md` count == 2.
