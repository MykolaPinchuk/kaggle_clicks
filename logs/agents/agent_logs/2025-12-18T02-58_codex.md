## Summary
1. Ran end-to-end smoke tests of the newly added Family A variants (gap, bucketized, calendar, event-count) on the existing 1% parquet sample (`data/interim/train_sample.parquet`, 403,698 rows).
2. Confirmed each variant path executes successfully and that the run reports record the selected configuration flags.

## Runs (outputs under `runs/`)
