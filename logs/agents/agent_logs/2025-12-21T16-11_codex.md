# Agent Log — VSCode Crash / OOM + Resume3

- Agent: Codex CLI
- Model: GPT-5.2
- Created (UTC): 2025-12-21T16:11:00+00:00

## Incident

- Another OOM event killed the baseline `python` process during `A4_gap1_foldA` (see `journalctl -k | rg -i "oom|killed process"`).
- This stopped the sweep runner mid-run (no `OK/FAIL` line for that run).

## Mitigations added

- `kaggle_clicks/run_baseline_te.py`: factorize object categorical columns to compact `int32` codes before TE to reduce memory pressure.
- `kaggle_clicks/time_agg.py`: avoid factorizing already-integer entity columns; factorize only object/string (and fallback) to reduce overhead.

## Current status

- Resumed sweep again (RESUME3) in `runs/sweeps/20251221_035134_paper_full_grid_10pct_s10pct/`.
