# Agent Log — 5% Promotion Runs (R3/R5/R8)

- Agent: Codex CLI
- Model: GPT-5.2
- Created (UTC): 2025-12-20T18:03:22+00:00

## Commands run

- Initial multi-run command timed out at 5 minutes; R3 folds completed, rest resumed individually.
- Completed runs (all with `n_estimators=400`, rolling-tail, 5% sample, preds exported):
  - `rolling_tail_5pct_R3_foldA` (A3 windows)
  - `rolling_tail_5pct_R3_foldB` (A3 windows)
  - `rolling_tail_5pct_R5_foldA/B` (gap g=1)
  - `rolling_tail_5pct_R8_foldA/B` (calendar windows)

## Notes

- Re-ran `rolling_tail_5pct_R3_foldB` to generate missing `metrics.json` after the timeout.
- Predictions are exported in each run dir (`preds_val.parquet`, `preds_test.parquet`).
