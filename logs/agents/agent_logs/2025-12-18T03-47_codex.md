# Agent Iteration Log
- Agent: Codex CLI (GPT-5.2)
- Timestamp: 2025-12-18T03:47:34Z
- Repo: kaggle_clicks

## Summary
1. Added a sweep runner for Family A (`kaggle_clicks/run_sweep_family_a.py`) that executes a predefined set of comparable runs (R0–R3 by default), captures stdout/stderr, and writes `summary.md`/`summary.csv` under `runs/sweeps/`.
2. Executed a Phase 0/1 sweep on the cached 1% sample and produced a summary table for TE-only vs trailing window sets.
3. Updated `docs/TIME_AGG_EXPERIMENTS.md` with sweep runner usage.
