# Agent Log — Wrap-up / Handoff (Working Paper v1)

- Agent: Codex CLI
- Model: GPT-5.2
- Created (UTC): 2025-12-25T15:46:17+00:00

## What is “done” for v1

The working-paper artifacts (tables + plots + inference where available) are consolidated under:

- `paper_draft/v1/README.md`

Key components:
- 10% TE+time-agg grid + inference + contrasts: `paper_draft/v1/10pct_paper_grid/`
- 10% time-agg-only grid (no TE): `paper_draft/v1/10pct_paper_grid_noTE/`
- 1% time-agg-only grid (no TE): `paper_draft/v1/1pct_paper_grid_noTE/`
- TE-only lift vs time-agg: `paper_draft/v1/10pct_te_lift/`

## Notable code changes during this agent run

- Added `--no-te` mode to `kaggle_clicks/run_baseline_te.py` (time-agg-only ablations while keeping `prior_ctr`).
- Added `--no-te` support to `kaggle_clicks/run_sweep_family_a_full_grid.py`.
- Added `kaggle_clicks/postprocess_paper_grid_contrasts.py` to compute within-length-set “shape vs trailing” contrasts using paired DeLong ROC-AUC.
- Improved feature name reporting in `kaggle_clicks/run_baseline_te.py` (maps `f0..fN` to `feature_cols` in Top Features table).

## Open items / next agent suggestions

- If the paper’s main results use the no-TE grids, consider adding statistical inference by rerunning only baseline + top-K specs with `--export-preds` and running paired inference.
- Otherwise, proceed to write the draft using `paper_draft/v1/10pct_paper_grid/` as the main results, with no-TE as a sensitivity appendix.
