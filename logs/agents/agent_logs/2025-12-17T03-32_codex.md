## Summary
1. Narrowed the experiment plan to focus exclusively on Family A, but expanded Family A to include multiple window shapes beyond simple trailing windows.
2. Updated `docs/TIME_AGG_EXPERIMENTS.md` to cover: gap windows, bucketized/disjoint windows, calendar-aligned windows, event-count windows, window-length schedules, stats to aggregate, and a staged sweep plan.
3. Added explicit approval questions to lock down which Family A variants to implement first.
