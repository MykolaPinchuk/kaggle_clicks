## What I read / inspected

- Operating rules: `agents.md`
- Onboarding packet + repo mental model: `docs/AGENT_ONBOARDING.md`
- Experiment plan + taxonomy: `docs/TIME_AGG_EXPERIMENTS.md`, `docs/plan_for_working_paper_results.md`
- Current results pointers: `docs/FAMILY_A_RESULTS.md`, `docs/SMOKE_FAMILY_A_RESULTS.md`, `docs/EDA_REPORT.md`
- Entrypoints / core modules:
  - `kaggle_clicks/run_baseline_te.py`, `kaggle_clicks/run_sweep_family_a.py`
  - `kaggle_clicks/time_utils.py`, `kaggle_clicks/te.py`, `kaggle_clicks/time_agg.py`
  - `kaggle_clicks/postprocess_sweep_inference.py`, `kaggle_clicks/inference_auc.py`, `kaggle_clicks/inference_bootstrap.py`

## Current mental model (1 paragraph)

CTR modeling on Avazu with strict chronological OOT splits. Core features are (1) time-aware target encoding (TE) where per-hour encodings use only history from earlier hours, and (2) online-safe entity-history (“time aggregation”) features (Family A) computed so that a row at hour H only uses information from <H (no same-hour leakage). Sweeps compare window *length sets* (A.2) and window *shapes* (A.1) under a frozen model/TE config, optionally using rolling-tail Fold A/B for a lightweight stability check.

## Key invariants / constraints

- Strict OOT: `train < val < test` chronologically; enforced by `kaggle_clicks/time_utils.py::assert_strict_oot`.
- Online simulation: `kaggle_clicks/time_agg.py` batches updates per hour (flush at hour boundary) to prevent same-hour leakage.
- Iteration budget: avoid runs expected to take >5 minutes unless explicitly approved.
- No git workflow changes (no commits/resets); `.gitignore` updates only if needed.

## Current state / next obvious work

- Existing sweeps and inference outputs live under `runs/sweeps/` (see `docs/FAMILY_A_RESULTS.md` and recent agent logs).
- The most recent handoff plan is `logs/agents/agent_logs/2025-12-20T20-49_codex.md`: run a full 20×2 (length set × shape, Fold A/B) grid on a 10% sample with resume/skip logic and then postprocess inference vs a baseline.

## Actions taken this session

- Read-only inspection (no code changes, no long-running jobs launched).
