# Agent Log — 2025-12-25T23-07Z (Codex / GPT-5.2) — Iteration Wrap-up

## What changed in this iteration

### Paper artifact consolidation (v1)
- `paper_draft/v1/` is the “single source of truth” for draft artifacts (manifest in `paper_draft/v1/README.md`).
- Added/updated READMEs to keep the paper-writing surface area small:
  - `paper_draft/v1/WRITER_ONBOARDING.md` (minimal read list for a writer agent)
  - `paper_draft/v1/10pct_paper_grid/README.md`
  - `paper_draft/v1/10pct_paper_grid_noTE/README.md`
- Snapshotted EDA into paper draft:
  - `paper_draft/v1/eda/EDA_REPORT.md` + `paper_draft/v1/eda/eda_assets/`
- Added combined TE vs no-TE comparison tables:
  - `paper_draft/v1/combined/te_vs_note_summary.md`
  - `paper_draft/v1/combined/te_vs_note_summary.csv`
  - `paper_draft/v1/combined/te_vs_note_by_fold.csv`

### Repro metadata copied into paper_draft
- TE grid repro: `paper_draft/v1/10pct_paper_grid/{commands.sh,sweep_config.json,source_sweep_dir.txt}`
- no-TE grid repro: `paper_draft/v1/10pct_paper_grid_noTE/{commands.sh,sweep_config.json,source_sweep_dir.txt}`

### Docs consistency
- Updated `docs/AGENT_ONBOARDING.md`:
  - fixed section numbering
  - added a “paper-writing agent quickstart” to keep context small
  - pointed to `paper_draft/v1/README.md` as the entrypoint
- Updated `docs/FAMILY_A_RESULTS.md` to reference the no-TE-with-inference sweep and `paper_draft/v1`.

## New/updated scripts
- `kaggle_clicks/postprocess_paper_grid_te_vs_note.py` (builds `paper_draft/v1/combined/*`)
- `kaggle_clicks/postprocess_paper_grid_master.py` (master table builder; used for no-TE-with-inference)

## What the next agent should do
- Primary task: write a preliminary paper draft using `paper_draft/v1/WRITER_ONBOARDING.md` and `paper_draft/v1/README.md` (avoid loading raw sweep logs/run dirs unless debugging).
- After writeup: answer reviewer-agent questions by referencing the specific tables/CSVs under `paper_draft/v1/`.
