# Agent Log — Shape vs Trailing Contrast Table (10% TE Sweep)

- Agent: Codex CLI
- Model: GPT-5.2
- Created (UTC): 2025-12-25T14:27:53+00:00

## What I generated

Within-length-set contrasts on the 10% TE paper grid: for each length set (A1–A4) and fold (A/B), compare each shape vs `trailing` using paired DeLong ROC-AUC inference.

- Sweep dir outputs:
  - `runs/sweeps/20251221_183006_paper_full_grid_10pct_s10pct_tecache/contrasts_vs_trailing_test.csv`
  - `runs/sweeps/20251221_183006_paper_full_grid_10pct_s10pct_tecache/contrasts_vs_trailing_test.md`
- Copied to paper draft:
  - `paper_draft/v1/10pct_paper_grid/contrasts_vs_trailing_test.csv`
  - `paper_draft/v1/10pct_paper_grid/contrasts_vs_trailing_test.md`

## Notes

- PR-AUC bootstrap CIs are not included (set `--bootstrap-reps > 0` to enable, at higher runtime).
