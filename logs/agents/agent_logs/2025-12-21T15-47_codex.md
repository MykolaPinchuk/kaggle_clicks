# Agent Log — Resume After VSCode Crash (OOM) + Memory Fixes

- Agent: Codex CLI
- Model: GPT-5.2
- Created (UTC): 2025-12-21T15:47:00+00:00

## Status

- The sweep had stopped due to an OOM kill of `python` (baseline run) at ~07:30 local time.
- The sweep has been resumed again and is currently running.

## Changes to reduce memory (to avoid OOM)

- `kaggle_clicks/time_agg.py`
  - Factorize entity keys to int codes before using them as dictionary keys (reduces memory from string keys).
- `kaggle_clicks/run_baseline_te.py`
  - Drop the large raw categorical DataFrame ASAP and keep only `hour_dt` for reporting/export.
  - Previous mitigation (single `X_all` + slice) remains in place.

## Current run

- Sweep dir: `runs/sweeps/20251221_035134_paper_full_grid_10pct_s10pct/`
- Resume launcher PID: `1119295`
- Currently running spec: `A4_gap1_foldA` (see `sweep.log`).
