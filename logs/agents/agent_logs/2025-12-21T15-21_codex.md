# Agent Log — 10% Grid Status (OOM) + Resume

- Agent: Codex CLI
- Model: GPT-5.2
- Created (UTC): 2025-12-21T15:21:00+00:00

## What happened overnight

- The 10% full grid stopped partway through:
  - Sweep dir: `runs/sweeps/20251221_035134_paper_full_grid_10pct_s10pct/`
  - Completed: 32/40 runs (up through `A4_trailing` fold B).
  - Last logged start: `A4_gap1_foldA` (no completion line).
  - An empty run dir exists: `runs/20251221_072216_paper_full_grid_10pct_A4_gap1_foldA/` (created but no artifacts written).
- Kernel logs indicate an OOM kill of a `python` process around that time (see `journalctl -k | rg -i "oom|killed process"`).

## Mitigation applied

- Reduced peak memory in `kaggle_clicks/run_baseline_te.py` by:
  - Dropping original categorical columns before building matrices.
  - Building a single dense `X_all` float32 array and slicing it (contiguous slices for OOT splits), instead of materializing 3 separate float32 DataFrames.

## Current action

- Resumed the same sweep dir with skip/resume logic and re-enabled inference at the end.
- New launcher PID: `1114637`
- Current progress visible in:
  - `runs/sweeps/20251221_035134_paper_full_grid_10pct_s10pct/sweep.log`
  - `runs/sweeps/20251221_035134_paper_full_grid_10pct_s10pct/launcher.log`
