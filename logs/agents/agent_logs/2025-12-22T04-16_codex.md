# Agent Log — 10% TE-only Baseline Added

- Agent: Codex CLI
- Model: GPT-5.2
- Created (UTC): 2025-12-22T04:16:34+00:00

## What I ran

Two TE-only runs on the 10% sample with rolling-tail Fold A/B (with prediction exports):

- `runs/20251222_040821_paper_teonly_10pct_foldA/`
- `runs/20251222_041044_paper_teonly_10pct_foldB/`

## What I computed

Paired inference on the test split:

- `paper_draft/v1/10pct_te_lift/inference_test_te_vs_timeagg.csv`
- `paper_draft/v1/10pct_te_lift/te_vs_timeagg_summary.md`

Headline lift vs TE-only:
- Fold A: A3 trailing ΔROC-AUC ≈ +0.00656, ΔPR-AUC ≈ +0.00939
- Fold B: A3 trailing ΔROC-AUC ≈ +0.00816, ΔPR-AUC ≈ +0.00840

## Paper draft packaging

Copied the small run reports/config/metrics into:
- `paper_draft/v1/10pct_te_lift/run_reports/`

## Minor code change

Improved feature name reporting in:
- `kaggle_clicks/run_baseline_te.py` (maps `f0..fN` to `feature_cols` for Top Features table)
