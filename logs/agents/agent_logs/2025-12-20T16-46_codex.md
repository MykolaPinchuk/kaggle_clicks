# Agent Log — Rolling Tail Fold Splits

- Agent: Codex CLI
- Model: GPT-5.2

## What changed

- Added rolling-tail Fold A/B split construction in `kaggle_clicks/time_utils.py` (`make_rolling_tail_folds_by_day`).
- Added `--rolling-tail-fold {A,B}` to `kaggle_clicks/run_baseline_te.py` to select those splits (default remains the existing day-based OOT split).
- Updated run report to record split mode.

## Sanity checks run

- Verified folds on `data/interim/train_sample.parquet`:
  - Fold A matches the existing default day-based split (train up to D-1, val=D-1, test=D).
  - Fold B shifts back one day (train up to D-2, val=D-2, test=D-1).
- Confirmed `assert_strict_oot(...)` passes for both folds.
