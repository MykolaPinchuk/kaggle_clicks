# Agent Iteration Log
- Agent: Codex CLI (GPT-5.2)
- Timestamp: 2025-12-18T02:50:20Z
- Repo: kaggle_clicks

## Summary
1. Implemented additional Family A time-aggregation variants in `kaggle_clicks/time_agg.py`: gap windows, bucketized disjoint windows, calendar-aligned windows (today/yesterday), and event-count windows (last N impressions, approximated by hour blocks; still no same-hour leakage).
2. Exposed the new variants via CLI flags in `kaggle_clicks/run_baseline_te.py` and updated the run report to record the selected time-agg configuration.
3. Added a short note to `docs/TIME_AGG_EXPERIMENTS.md` mapping the plan variants to the new CLI flags.

## Files changed
- `kaggle_clicks/time_agg.py`
- `kaggle_clicks/run_baseline_te.py`
- `docs/TIME_AGG_EXPERIMENTS.md`
- `logs/agents/agent_logs/2025-12-18T02-50_codex.md`

## Notes
- Ran small synthetic checks to validate the no-same-hour leakage behavior for trailing, gap, bucket, and calendar windows.
