# Agent Log — 2025-12-25T23-33Z (Codex / GPT-5.2) — Writer Brief + Figure Pack

## Goal
Provide a writer-facing narrative writeup and ensure the v1 paper artifacts include a small set of easy-to-digest “main finding” plots.

## What changed
### Writer brief
- Added results-first narrative brief: `paper_draft/v1/WRITER_BRIEF.md`

### Figure manifest + curated plot pack
- Added figure manifest with recommended placement (main vs appendix): `paper_draft/v1/FIGURE_MANIFEST.md`
- Added plot generator script: `human_src/generate_paper_plots_v1.py`
- Added curated output directory (generated PNGs): `paper_draft/v1/plots/`
  - `paper_draft/v1/plots/te_lift_metrics.png`
  - `paper_draft/v1/plots/te_lift_deltas.png`
  - `paper_draft/v1/plots/heatmap_test_roc_te_vs_note.png`
  - `paper_draft/v1/plots/shape_contrasts_te_vs_note.png`
  - `paper_draft/v1/plots/te_vs_note_uplift.png`
- Updated manifest to link the brief + figure manifest: `paper_draft/v1/README.md`

## What I ran
- `python human_src/generate_paper_plots_v1.py`
