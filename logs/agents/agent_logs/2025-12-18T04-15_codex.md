## Summary
1. Ran the Phase 2 Family A shape sweep on 1% sample (R0–R9), produced an updated sweep summary, and identified the best-performing variant on 1% as A3+event(50).
2. Promoted the key candidates to 5% with frozen model params: TE-only vs A3 trailing vs A3+event(50) and confirmed a small but consistent lift for A3+event(50).
3. Added `docs/FAMILY_A_RESULTS.md` as a pointer index to the sweep summaries and the comparable 5% promotion runs.
