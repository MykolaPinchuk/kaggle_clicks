## Summary
1. Drafted an approval-ready experimental plan for time aggregation feature construction methods in `docs/TIME_AGG_EXPERIMENTS.md`.
2. Plan covers feature families (fixed windows, trend deltas, EWMA/decay, recency variants, hour-of-day conditioning, and later interaction keys), window sets, and a staged ablation/composition strategy with strict OOT + online constraints.
3. Added a pointer to the new plan doc in `README.md`.

## Open items for human approval
- Window sets (A1/A2/A3) and sweep order confirmation.
- Whether to use 1-day vs 2-day validation during the sweep.
