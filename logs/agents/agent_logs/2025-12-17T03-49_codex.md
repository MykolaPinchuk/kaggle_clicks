## Summary
1. Finalized the Family A time-aggregation experiment plan in `docs/TIME_AGG_EXPERIMENTS.md` (removed approval-draft language, removed redundant sections, clarified run phases and variants).
2. Reconciled documentation for consistency with the current codebase: updated `docs/PLAN.md` to reflect TE (not OHE), streaming time aggregation, and current run artifacts; updated `README.md` wording to match default behavior.

## Files changed
- `docs/TIME_AGG_EXPERIMENTS.md`
- `docs/PLAN.md`
- `README.md`

## Notes
- No implementation changes were made in this iteration; this is documentation-only cleanup preparing for the next implementation phase.
