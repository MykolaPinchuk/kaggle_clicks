# Agent Iteration Log
- Agent: Codex (GPT-5)
- Timestamp: 2025-12-17T03:03:34Z
- Repo: kaggle_clicks

## Summary
1. Added human-readable run reporting to `kaggle_clicks/run_baseline_te.py`, generating `report.md` alongside config/metrics/model per run (includes data summary, feature config, split metrics, and top feature importances).
2. Ensured feature names persist by training XGBoost directly on pandas DataFrames, enabling gain-based rankings.
3. Updated docs (`README.md`, `docs/PLAN.md`) to mention the new reporting artifact.
4. Validated on 1% and 5% samples (`runs/20251217_025909_sample1pct_timeagg_report`, `runs/20251217_030026_sample5pct_timeagg_report`) confirming ~35s and ~2m50s runtimes respectively and producing comprehensive Markdown reports.

## Notes
- Metrics JSON schema now nests per-split metrics under `splits` with `best_iteration` at the top level (backward incompatible with earlier runs).
- Feature importance table currently reports top 15 features by gain share; adjust `MAX_FEATURES` in `_write_report` if needed.
