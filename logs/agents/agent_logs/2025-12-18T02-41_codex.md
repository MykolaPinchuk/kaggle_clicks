# Agent Iteration Log
- Agent: Codex CLI (GPT-5.2)
- Timestamp: 2025-12-18T02:41:27Z
- Repo: kaggle_clicks

## Summary
1. Read the repo docs (`README.md`, `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/DATA.md`, `docs/TIME_AGG_EXPERIMENTS.md`) to understand the OOT evaluation protocol, baseline, and the planned Family A time-aggregation sweep.
2. Reviewed the current implementation entrypoint and core feature code (`kaggle_clicks/run_baseline_te.py`, `kaggle_clicks/te.py`, `kaggle_clicks/time_agg.py`, `kaggle_clicks/time_utils.py`) to confirm how TE and streaming time-agg features are computed without same-hour leakage.
3. Verified expected run artifacts and reporting format by inspecting an existing run report under `runs/`.
